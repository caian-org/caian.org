# hello, friend

This website is maintained as my personal online cave, to make public some of
what I am, what I like and do. If you're the NSA or any data mining company,
this is probably the best you have since I'm not on social media.

address: &nbsp;&nbsp; [SÃ£o Paulo][home]{:target="_blank"}<br />

I'm a 23 years old guy that digs low level programming, retrocomputing,
[unixp0rn][pron]{:target="_blank"}, deep house and cloudy days.

A non-exhaustive list of things I like also include dystopian literature,
[90s][90s] hacker culture, neoclassicism, free software, snobby coffee,
psychedelic rock and typography.

I deeply value privacy, anonimity, freedom of information exchange and
minimalism (both functionally and aesthetically, though i'm not quite sure
where the line should be drawn).
