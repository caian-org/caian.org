I wish someone had taught me that lesson about not putting all the eggs in one
basket earlier in life. This is true in many senses, but specially when it
comes to emotions and finances.

One cannot truly appreciate and understand the wisdom of others until the pain
that comes from learning about reality kicks you in the face. Pain always
precedes learning.

The human experience is cyclical and you can see all kinds of people making the
same mistakes over and over again. _Life without guarantees is scary_ but I
suppose that's the burden of abandoning childhood.
