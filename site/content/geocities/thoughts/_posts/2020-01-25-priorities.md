"you should enjoy your life now before it's too late", said every boomer ever
to me. "you should focus on your studies and work hard now, think about the
future!" also said by every boomer ever to me.

_One should pick priorities._ I don't believe these things are mutually
exclusive, but you cannot properly have both at the same time.

Where the line should be drawn? I don't know and I try not to invest much
thought on it. Life by itself is stressing already and worrying whether I'm
having "enough fun" is a free call for more anxiety.
