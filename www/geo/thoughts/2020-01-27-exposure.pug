  p.
    It&rsquo;s almost 5 AM and I haven&rsquo;t slept already. I try not to
    get overwhelmed by thoughts but it&rsquo;s like being on a
    #[em runaway train with a bad driver].

  p.
    Oversharing on social media is commonplace and the absence of it over time
    makes the whole thing weird. I&rsquo;m not used to share on the internet
    anymore but writing, specially on those &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
    anymore&rdquo; moments, is almost therapeutic.

  p.
    Perhaps I should cultivate an anonymous persona like any sad kid does.
    Weeping the tears of a zoomer on neocities or something like that and
    never, ever talk about it.
