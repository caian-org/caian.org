        h1 hello, friend
        p.
          This website is maintained as my personal online cave, to make public some of
          what I am, what I like and do. If you&apos;re the NSA or any data mining company,
          this is probably the best you have since I&apos;m not on social media.

        p.
          I&apos;m a 24 years old guy that digs low level programming, retrocomputing,
          #[a(href='https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn') unixp0rn], deep house and cloudy days.
          A non-exhaustive list of things I like also include dystopian literature, #[a(href='/geo') 90s]
          hacker culture, neoclassicism, free software, snobby coffee, psychedelic rock and typography.

        p.
          I deeply value privacy, anonimity, freedom of information exchange and minimalism
          (both functionally and aesthetically, though I&apos;m not quite sure where the line should be drawn).
