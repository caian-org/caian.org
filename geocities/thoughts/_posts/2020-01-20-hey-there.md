It's official: I have a grand total of *ZERO* accounts on social media right
now. Linkedin was the last one and I'm glad I did it.

I've cleared most of my presence online but I don't want to hide myself. This
whole website has the bold goal of being, at the same time, the equivalent of
twitter, instagram, last.fm and whatnot.

I'll not-so-regularly post some photos, thoughts of mine and stuff I'm
consuming. It could be a piece of music or a crazy site I've found on
neocities. Pray for me so I don't give up after three months.
