I don't want to talk about it and you probably don't want to hear too. We know
what's happening and it ain't good. It's been so long since the last time I
spoke, I'm almost forgetting how to do it.

Plans and ideas all thrown in the garbage. I saw heroes becoming monsters. I
saw people dying, and rebirthing, and then dying again. *I wish I could save
them all, really*. Me, well, I'm trying to collect myself and make sense out of
this clusterfuck and truth be told, I'm doing it.

It's a bittersweet end, for sure. Most of it, as always for my desperation, out
of my control.
