I've been wanting and waiting to move out since I'm 18. Five years forward, I
finally have the resources (and the maturity) to do so.

Finding a nice, well located apartment hasn't been the easiest task so far. The
prices are high and God knows how awful some places are. Either bad
neighborhoods or straight up dirty and non-ventilated places that certainly are
health hazards.

*I'm moving alone.* I suppose something like 40m2 are enough for me and the
half dozen of my belongs. If everything goes accordingly, by the end of this
semester I'll have my own place.
