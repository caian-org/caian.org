It's almost 5 AM and I haven't slept already. I try not to get overwhelmed by
thoughts but it's like being on a *runaway train with a bad driver*.

Oversharing on social media is commonplace and the absence of it over time
makes the whole thing weird. I'm not used to share on the internet anymore but
writing, specially on those "I can't anymore" moments, is almost therapeutic.

Perhaps I should cultivate an anonymous persona like any sad kid does. Weeping
the tears of a zoomer on neocities or something like that and never, ever talk
about it.
