        <p>
            I maintain this website as my personal online cave, to make public
            some of what I am, what I like and do. If you're the NSA, ABIN or
            any data mining company, this is the best you have, since I'm not
            on any social media plataform.

        <h2>whois caian.org</h2>

        <p>
            A 21 years old programmer (did you mean
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_monkey" target="_blank">code monkey</a>?)
            called Caian R. Ertl who lives in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and makes a
            living developing solutions in automation, monitoring and
            serverless/cloud applications.  More dev than sysadmin. More
            <b>/g/</b> than <b>/pol/</b>, though sometimes the monster wakens
            up.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have a collection of unfinished free software projects, a weird
            taste for terminal applications like vim, tmux and mutt and a dead
            serious need to create shortcuts for everything in my life that
            takes more than 30 secs (though I'm not always have the time or
            energy to do that).
        </p>

        <p>
            I deeply value privacy, anonymity, freedom of information exchange
            and minimalism (more in the functional perspective, like in the
            Unix philosophy or the DRY and KISS principles, than
            aesthetically). My tastes are half cliche, half unheard. Code,
            vintage technology, vaporwave (synthwave and deep house too), ASCII
            art and hacker culture (the more kitsch, the better).
