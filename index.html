        A 21 years old programmer (did you mean
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_monkey">code monkey</a>?)
        called Caian R.  Ertl who lives in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and makes a
        living developing solutions in automation, monitoring and
        serverless/cloud applications.  More dev than sysadmin. More <b>/g/</b>
        than <b>/pol/</b>, though sometimes the monster wakens up.

    <p>
        I have a collection of unfinished free software projects, a weird taste
        for terminal applications like vim, tmux and scim and a dead serious
        need to create shortcuts for everything in my life that takes more than
        30 secs (though most of the time I do not have the time or energy to
        automate such things).
