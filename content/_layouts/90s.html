        The Aneristic Principle is that of apparent order; the Eristic Principle is that of apparent disorder. Both
        order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of pure chaos, which is a level deeper
        than is the level of distinction making. It is only the ideas-about-reality which differ. Real (capital-T) True
        reality is a level deeper than is the level of concept. We look at the world through windows on which have been
        drawn grids (concepts). Different philosophies use different grids. A culture is a group of people with rather
        similar grids. Through a window we view chaos, and relate it to the points on our grid, and thereby understand
        it. The order is in the grid. That is the Aneristic Principle. Disorder is simply unrelated information viewed
        through some particular grid. But, like "relation", no-relation is a concept. Male, like female, is an idea
        about sex. To say that male-ness is "absence of female-ness", or vice versa, is a matter of definition and
        metaphysically arbitrary. The artificial concept of no-relation is the Eristic Principle. The belief that "order
        is true" and disorder is false or somehow wrong, is the Aneristic Illusion. To say the same of disorder, is the
        Eristic Illusion. The point is that (little-t) truth is a matter of definition relative to the grid one is using
        at the moment, and that (capital-T) Truth, metaphysical reality, is irrelevant to grids entirely. Pick a grid,
        and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered. Pick another grid, and the same chaos
        will appear differently ordered and disordered. Reality is the original Rorschach.
