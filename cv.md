## summary

I'm a bachelor's student in computer information systems at the [Anhembi
Morumbi University](anhembi.br), working in the field since 2015, mainly with
cloud computing solutions and software development. Computers and coding have
been my main interest since the elementary school; my very first program was an
online chat using batch scripts and a FTP server on a Windows XP machine
(seriously).

products, from the user experience to the technical aspects. During the same
period, I have directly worked with small and medium business (1-99 employees),
