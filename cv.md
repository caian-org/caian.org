## summary

I'm a 21 years old bachelor's student in computer information systems at the
[Anhembi Morumbi University](http://portal.anhembi.br), working in the field
since 2015, mainly with cloud computing solutions and software development.
Computers and coding have been my main interest since the elementary school; my
very first program was an online chat using batch scripts and a FTP server on a
Windows XP machine (**seriously**).

My role within the team was to sketch, develop and test case-specific solutions
based on the needs of our customers. These solutions have ranged from custom
made web services and mobile applications to the deployment and pipeline of
workflow management softwares. I've taken part in three projects, namely, one
online corporate university for a brazilian finance institution. As an agile,
scrum-based team, we routinely worked alongside our customer's analysts and
project managers.

Key responsibilities:

I've migrated over twenty medium-large businesses from on-premise, legacy
and/or non-digital solutions to the cloud with G Suite, helping teams to work
more efficiently, fastly and securely. In each transition to Google, I played a
central role as an "Account Manager", providing in depth support, transitioning
legacy data with integrity, adapting workflows and ensuring a smooth and
continuous adoption curve.

Key responsibilities:

As a technical support intern, my biggest goal was to help our customers to
take full advantage of the G Suite (formerly known as Google Apps for Work)
products, from the user experience to the technical aspects. During the same
period, I have directly worked with small and medium business (1-99 employees),
planning and running "Google deployments" (i.e., the G Suite deployment) and
digital transformations from legacy systems or non-digital environments to the
cloud.

Key responsibilities:
 - Customer technical support;
 - In loco trainings and workshops;
 - Planning and running of G Suite deployments (small-medium businesses);
 - Technical guides and tutorials aimed for customers.
